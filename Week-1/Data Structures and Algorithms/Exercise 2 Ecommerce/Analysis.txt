Time Complexity Comparison:
Search Type	Best Case	Average Case	Worst Case
Linear Search	O(1)	O(n)	O(n)
Binary Search	O(1)	O(log n)	O(log n)

Which Algorithm is More Suitable and Why:
Linear Search is simple and does not require the data to be sorted. It's useful when the dataset is small or unsorted.

Binary Search is significantly faster for large datasets but requires the array to be sorted beforehand.

Conclusion:
For an e-commerce platform with potentially thousands of products, Binary Search is more suitable due to its logarithmic time complexity, which ensures faster search results. However, if product data changes frequently (insertions/deletions), maintaining a sorted array can add overhead.
