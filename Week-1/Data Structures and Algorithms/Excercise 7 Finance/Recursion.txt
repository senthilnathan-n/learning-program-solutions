What is Recursion?
Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of a problem. It continues breaking down the problem until it reaches a base case.

How Recursion Simplifies Problems:
Breaks complex problems into smaller, manageable sub-problems.

Reduces code complexity for repetitive, self-similar tasks (e.g., calculating compound interest over years).

Offers an elegant and intuitive way to express mathematical formulas, such as:

Future Value = Principal × (1 + Interest Rate)ⁿ

which naturally maps to recursive implementation.
