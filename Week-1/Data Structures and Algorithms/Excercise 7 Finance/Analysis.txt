Time Complexity of Recursive Algorithm:
The recursive function predictFuturevalue is called once for each year, decrementing years until it reaches 0.

Hence, the time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of years.

Optimization Suggestion:
While the current implementation is efficient for small n, deeper recursion could lead to stack overflow for large values of years.

Optimizations:

Tail Recursion: Rewrite the function to use tail recursion (if the language/compiler supports tail call optimization).

Memoization: Store results of subproblems in a cache to avoid redundant calculations.

Iterative Approach: Replace recursion with a loop to eliminate function call overhead and improve memory efficiency.
